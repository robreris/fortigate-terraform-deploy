# Deployment of FortiGate-VM (PAYG/BYOL) A-A on the AWS
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM A-A on AWS in single AZ with two load balancers.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider >= AWS 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider >= Template 2.2.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A AWS VPC with 4 subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM (PAYG) instances with two NICs in Single AZ.
   - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
   - Two Route tables: one for internal subnet and one for external subnet.
   - Two Load Balancers: one for external and one for internal.
   - External Load Balancer: Network Load balancer has default rules for port 80 and 443 which will forward traffic to the two FortiGate units. 
   - Internal Load Balancer: Network Load balancer has default rules for port 80 and 443.   User will need to add the target groups for the internal load balancer's target group.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

FGTActivePublicIP = <Active FGT Public IP>
FGTLBPublicFQDN = <External Load Balancer FQDN>
FGTLBPublicIP = <External Load Balancer IP>
FGTPassivePublicIP = <Passive FGT Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = <FGT admin>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
