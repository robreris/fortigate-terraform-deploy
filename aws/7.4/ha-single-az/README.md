# Deployment of FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) Cluster on the AWS
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM Cluster on AWS in Single AZ Topology

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template 2.2.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A AWS VPC with 4 subnets
   - Two FortiGate-VM (PAYG) instances with four NICs in Single AZ.
   - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
   - Two Route tables: one for internal subnet and one for external subnet.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

FGTActiveMGMTPublicIP = <Active FGT Management Public IP>
FGTClusterPublicFQDN = <Cluster Public FQDN>
FGTClusterPublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
FGTPassiveMGMTPublicIP = <Passive FGT Management Pubcli IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = <FGT admin>

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
