# Deployment of two FortiGate-VMs (BYOL/PAYG) on the AWS with GWLB integration in Cross-AZ scenario
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy two FortiGate-VMs in two different AZs on AWS with Gateway Load Balancer intergration.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS >= 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* FOS Version >= 6.4.4

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - 1 AWS VPC
        - FGT VPC with 2 public subnets, 2 private subnets, and 2 endpoint subnets in two different AZs. 
           - 1 Internet Gateway
           - 1 NAT Gateway
           - 2 Route table with private subnets association for each AZ, and default route with target to each AZ's GWLB endpoint.
           - 1 Route table with public subnets association, and default route with target to Internet Gateway.
           - 2 Route tabls with endpoint subnet associations for each AZ, and default route with target to each AZ's NAT Gateway for egress traffic. 
   - Two FortiGate-VM each instance with 2 NICs : port1 on public subnet and port2 on private subnet in different AZ.
           - port2 will be in its own FG-traffic vdom.
           - A geneve interface will be created base on port2 during bootstrap and this will be the interface where traffic will received from the Gateway Load Balancer.
   - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
   - One Gateway Load Balancer with two targets to two FortiGates.
   - Two Gateway Load Balancer endpoints configured to integrate with the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint service.
        

## Topology overview
Security VPC (10.1.0.0/16)
       public-az1   (10.1.0.0/24)
       private-az1  (10.1.1.0/24)
       public-az2   (10.1.2.0/24)
       private-az2  (10.1.3.0/24)
       endpoint-az1 (10.1.4.0/24)
       endpoint-az2 (10.1.5.0/24)


FortiGate VMs are deployed in Security VPC on both public and private subnet
One FortiGate VM is deployed in AZ 1, while another one is deployed in AZ 2. 
Server(s) may be deployed in the private subnet in the Security VPC in either AZ.

Egress traffic from the Server(s) located in the private subnet in Customer VPC will be routed to GWLB and redirect to FortiGate-VM's geneve interface and send back out to GWLB endpoint. 

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VMs to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

CustomerVPC = <Customer VPC>
FGT1PublicIP = <FGT1 Public IP>
FGT2PublicIP = <FGT2 Public IP>
FGTVPC = <FGT VPC>
LoadBalancerPrivateIP = <Private Load Balancer IP>
Password_for_FGT1 = <FGT1 Password>
Password_for_FGT2 = <FGT2 Password>
Username = <FGT Username>

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
